Greedy Algorithm
----------------
Idea: build large solutions up from smaller ones, keeping/following only the best solution along the way.


Rules of Thumb
--------------
* 16MB max memory use
* 2^10 ~ 10^3
* 100M actions per second
* Recursive with `b` calls per level and `l` levels: `O(b^l)
* N! permutations, 2^n subsets of N elements
* Best time for sorting N elements: O(N log N)





Indexing
--------
Some common sense stuff, but might be helpful from time to time

Length of a[i]...a[j] = j-i+1

Combination C(n,r) = n! / (r! (n-r)!)

Permutation P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!
